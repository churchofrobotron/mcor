              <div class='cor_text_block_header'>ABOUT</div>
              The Church of Robotron is a mobile training facility that uses hazardous environments, religious
              indoctrination, and emotional triggers to promote the development of the skills necessary to survive in a
              hostile post-human environment.

              We hope to use our field installation to educate and indoctrinate people about the robot uprising in
              progress. We know that superior machines exist, we know that they have already decided that the human race
              must be destroyed, and we know that the only way to convey this knowledge is with a visceral and even
              spiritual ordeal.

              The savior of our species must be identified and trained; the tragic
              sacrifice of legions of subjects is the burden that we must
              shoulder, lightened only by the willingness with which they
              volunteer for their grisly testing. Please, read our
              literature, attend a sermon or two, tell your friends, and when
              the time comes, report to an orientation session. Survivors
              will earn the exaltation of a grateful humanity. The mightiest
              will experience the glory of the leaderboard and receive useful
              items. Thank you, it is only with your selfless dedication that
              hope survives. --KRA

                    Another morning. Time to drag myself out of bed and get to work. I guess I have the best job in the
                    city. I work for myself, and there's no shortage of things to do. Having a reason to get out of bed
                    is more than most people have these days, and I should be thankful for that, but the routine gets to
                    me sometimes. I just don't know that I'm making a difference in the world anymore.
                    <p>
                      How long has it been this way? It's hard to say. I was born with all the advantages, including an
                      expensive new designer template. My parents were so proud. Everyone told me I had a happy and
                      productive future ahead of me. It never felt like that to me, though. There were some adjustment
                      problems when I was young - behavioral issues at school, the genetic counselors couldn't explain
                      my poor performance during career determination sessions. I didn't quite fit in, which was
                      confusing. Everybody fit in.
                      <p>
                        On my thirteenth birthday, the phenotypists just gave up. Genetic engineering error, they said.
                        Out of scope, you're on your own. It didn't really worry my parents. It was an exciting time,
                        new avenues were always opening up. They were sure I'd find a niche; the family genome would see
                        greater expression.
                        <p>
                          Things didn't work out as well as they had hoped. It was harder to find a job as I grew older.
                          Robots had been taking up a growing part of the labor force, of course, and the most recent
                          generation, the Robotrons, were better than people at most things. There were fewer openings
                          for humans to contribute, and always someone more qualified for the job. It was all the same
                          work for all the same people, and I wasn't one of them. I wasn't seeing any new templates,
                          just Mommies, Daddies, and Mikeys. Nobody wanted to be different anymore. My own family got
                          re-templated, except for me - I couldn't, because I didn't match a planned pattern. There was
                          no place for me. I was having trouble understanding people when they talked. They didn't move
                          their faces right. I couldn't pick up much from the TV, either, it was all idioms and cultural
                          references that I wasn't privy to. I avoided people, ended up living on the streets.
                          <p>
                            Nobody really noticed when I dropped out of society. Its not like I had any friends at that
                            point. Nobody really did anything anymore anyway, the Robotrons took care of everything. At
                            least, they seemed to be, but I didn't understand them, either, which isn't too surprising
                            now that I think about it. People created the Robotrons to do what they didn't want to do
                            themselves, but I couldn't tell what they did want to do. Robotrons built things, they ran
                            the city government, they went shopping. They made art, wrote books, and played music. They
                            were busy and industrious, always on the move, while the Mommies, Daddies, and Mikeys seemed
                            to just wander around.
                            <p>
                              Then one day I was rooting through the trash and saw a cargo hulk run a Mommy down. Just
                              killed her on the sidewalk and kept walking. There was a Daddy right next to her, and he
                              didn't even notice. I was stunned for a moment. Stood there staring with my mouth open.
                              Then a police grunt turned towards me and smashed through the dumpster I was hiding
                              behind. I jumped clear just in time, or I would have been toast.
                              <p>
                                I avoided the surface levels for a long time after that. I don't remember how long I
                                lived that way. The world had gone crazy, and I went crazy with it. But eventually I had
                                to climb back up to forage, and I wanted to know what it was like up there. A part of me
                                was still connected to society, whatever that was. It was a mess, but there were a few
                                Mommies, Daddies, and Mikeys wandering around, completely oblivious. I learned later
                                that there were still conceptories making them. Robotrons were grabbing people, taking
                                them apart, and reassembling them. I saw what used to be a Mikey sprinting down the
                                street for whatever reason, yelling something about pizza interpolation.
                                <p>
                                  So yeah, it was fucked up, but what else was new? I basically kept doing what I had
                                  always done, rooting in the trash for what I needed. For a while I amused myself by
                                  getting chased by grunts and tricking them into crashing into electric pylons. It was
                                  a dangerous pastime, but what did it matter? What kind of future was there for me,
                                  anyway?
                                  <p>
                                    Then I was scrounging around in some old warehouse district. It was really old,
                                    there were written signs and everything. Very few people had known how to read for
                                    years, the Robotrons did all of that for us. It was some kind of engineering
                                    research facility, engineers also being a profession which hadn't been needed for a
                                    long time. There, I discovered the item which has kept me alive to this day, a
                                    prototype anti-robot laser. This must have been some kind of rogue operation, nobody
                                    had a use for weapons back in the day. The Robotrons had brought on world peace.
                                    <p>
                                      It was just the tool I needed, and I read the lab notes eagerly. "Shoots in eight
                                      directions." "Immediately fatal to Robotrons." Then my hopes were dashed.
                                      "Unusable by normal people. Requires superhuman strength to wield."
                                      <p>
                                        Well, there it was right there. I picked it up easily, charged it, and fired,
                                        taking out the whole wall. Apparently that genetic engineering error had given
                                        me superhuman strength - or, more likely, all the modern templates were weak,
                                        with the Robotrons handling all of the hard labor.
                                        <p>
                                          I'd like to say my life was changed by that discovery. I'd like to say it
                                          became fun again, a game. The truth is, it's not much different. So here I am,
                                          it's another morning. Every day I crawl out of my hideout and climb to the
                                          surface. I clear another area of Robotrons and rescue the humans. I don't know
                                          why I do it. Wave after wave of Robotrons keep coming, and wave after wave of
                                          the last human family as well, the same three people. It's kind of pointless.
                                          And what do I get out of it? Days of killing robots, nights spent in the
                                          company of Mommies, Daddies, and Mikeys. They are not very interesting
                                          company. They have no idea what's going on. All they can talk about is the
                                          latest meme, the same thing, over and over again. But still I do it. I don't
                                          know, it's a living. At least I have a job. --KRA

                                  towards his own handsome sea of blue blazers milling around the worker transports.
                                  <p>
                                    I do not wish I was middle-aged. Being a Mikey is about growing and learning. Being
                                    a Daddy is all about work. Data mining all the livelong day. Searching for entropy,
                                    the most precious commodity, the one thing the machines can't think up. They take
                                    care of us, the Daddies take care of them, and the Mommies take care of the Daddies.
                                    <p>
                                      Being a Mommy, that's the good life. I sigh happily on my doorstep. It was a good
                                      family permutation this time. Every evening, I stand on this doorstep as the
                                      transports pull up. I see the waves of blue and red strolling down the sidewalk,
                                      until one man and one boy walk through this door. It's a wonderful feeling, full
                                      of potential.
                                      <p>
                                        I asked my husband why he chose to walk up to my doorstep one night. Why not the
                                        house next door? He didn't understand the question. "It's the entropy, honey.
                                        It's - it's where I went." And it was a silly question. What would the
                                        permutation be if we tried to influence it? What kind of people would we be?
                                        <p>
                                          My thoughts are interrupted by a commotion down the lane, and I have my
                                          answer. It's that thing again. That fanatic. That freak who is not the kind of
                                          people we are. Not a Daddy, not a Mikey, not a Mommy. An error.
                                          <p>
                                            I know what's going to happen. I saw it three waves ago. He destroys things,
                                            and slaps his weird religious propaganda everywhere. Some kind of
                                            traditionalist dogma, wanting to go back to the old days - one hundred years
                                            ago exactly, for some reason. 1984. A libertarian paradise, according to his
                                            cult. I don't understand any of it.
                                            <p>
                                              This time, he's fashioned some kind of weapon, a construction laser or
                                              something. I sigh again, this time in resignation. A transport gets its
                                              motivator sliced off and crashes into a house. Burning Mikeys run in all
                                              directions. A beam bounces off a confused hulk, which plows through a
                                              crowd of Daddies, skidding in the gore. A squad of grunts drone towards
                                              the terrorist and stumble into an electrode field.
                                              <p>
                                                A factory robotron starts generating enforcers and the battle quickly
                                                becomes pitched, but just as quickly, it's over. The mutant looks at me,
                                                and then he's gone, off to spread his havoc somewhere else.
                                                <p>
                                                  I survey my street, which is again quiet and peaceful. Daddies and
                                                  Mikeys stumble into transports. I wonder if this morning's Mikey is
                                                  among those charred bodies. I hope not. It was a good permutation. I
                                                  hope this evening's works out as well. --KRA

                        Our people, the only remaining people, they took excess. We mechanized perfection, and this was

                          <p>
                            We did it on purpose, and my friends, we did it with conviction!

                              Now we're tired of swimming in our own waste.
                              I tell you human cousins, this was our own undoing. This was our seed mistake. We ARE the

                    Fucking grunt!
                    <p>
                      If it hadn't been for the existence of that particular grunt, none of this would have happened.
                      <p>
                        Sure, I'd seen the patrols before. First in downtown, strutting their mass and letting the
                        masses know their presence. Then not too much later near the open-late markets in the sketchy
                        part of town. Who cares about that shit anyway? Those pockets of bad food and crime and grime
                        are shame anwyay... let them be patrolled, and let's clean it up, we all said.
                        <p>
                          Pretty soon they had station in most of the heavy traffic intersections, then the gated
                          communities in the burbs. It's fine, they're helping.
                          <p>
                            That enforcer that we noticed for the first time at the polls 3 years ago? All good!
                            Pre-market votesway was down by 50%, and the entire squad only put down 64 voters in the 300
                            designations. The riots didn't matter. It was time to reel in those fringes anyway. For
                            unity. For harmony.
                            <p>
                              And really, it wasn't that bad... until that stray fucker ran down Jes in my alley.
                              <p>
                                I had my briefcase packed and I was even halfway out the door when I had that awful
                                moment of self-doubt. Had I locked the back gate after dragging the recycling tanks to
                                the alley? I was certain that I had. But maybe my memory was wrong. Maybe I had been
                                replaying the +0 entertainicom too intensely (in hopes of making bonus with my superior
                                today). Maybe I was just straight-up tired from the lack of sleep in the summer humidity
                                (microclimate shroud be damned!). It didn't matter. I had to check.
                                <p>
                                  So I went around through the side gate, back to the back gate. I tugged hard down
                                  twice on the lock, and on the second time it fell long. I should have known something
                                  was astray.
                                  <p>
                                    The next thing I felt was blood spraying the side of my face.
                                    <p>
                                      Blood soaking.
                                      <p>
                                        Blood sprayed, from the collar of Jes.
                                        <p>
                                          Jes was our neighborhood's transient grardener and reclaimer. We're sure she
                                          had a drug problem (all the reclaimers had drug problems), but she was an
                                          amazing gardener. Because of that, the block tolerated the persistent
                                          reclaiming. She had alley potatoes as bribe in mid summer... and by the time
                                          fall finally closed there were retail baskets of sidecorp gourds and squash.
                                          Constantly changing, as with the seasons, as with our genetics. Part of us,
                                          part of our irrelevant system, but not integrated.
                                          <p>
                                            The same way her head and neck were being disintegrated from her torso. Now.
                                            <p>
                                              As the gate swings open, I quell my violent impulse with imagined order.
                                              "These grunts aren't even supposed to be in here." After all, this was a
                                              peaceful garbage alley. I peek my head out first to survey the grunt's
                                              position, and then I scan Jes. There's no hope for her now. Complete
                                              detachment. Convulsions. Puddle.
                                              <p>
                                                But that mechanical fucker is plodding on, glitched to shit, reflecting
                                                off of each fence and hulking side to side. There's a trickle of black
                                                smoke coming from the back torso, and hell, I think I'm seeing sparks
                                                from the fake mouth.
                                                <p>
                                                  Now I'm actually pissed. I'm running toward it and lodging my
                                                  briefcase between the fake thigh and fake pelvis (a move I'd seen
                                                  inner-city kids do with skate decks). It lunges forward and then
                                                  topples backward. A blast of electrons surges out from the grunt and
                                                  arcs like a 90-armed spider... then, splayed on its back, it begins
                                                  the frenzy of limbs. Fake arms and fake legs kicking and swinging as
                                                  fast as the SDTM motors will allow.
                                                  <p>
                                                    And it's not going anywhere.
                                                    <p>
                                                      And so I find a cinderblock nearby and hurl it overhand, overhead
                                                      at the grunt. Its flail mode defense parrys the attack and the
                                                      brick splits in two. Fucking lucky! There's containers of paint
                                                      and oil being reclaimed nearby, and I manage to hurl these one
                                                      after another at the twitching monster. Its limb spasms knock the
                                                      paint to the left and coat it in sparkle blue. The oil canister is
                                                      obliterated and the oil splashes violently into the fake face of
                                                      the grunt, coating it slick black. And there is a brief plasma
                                                      fume and then it stops moving.
                                                      <p>
                                                        I'm quickly opening its maintenance plate and tearing at random
                                                        shit. Seconds of adrenaline fear are turning into minutes of
                                                        hyperventilation. And now, there's a hulk at each end of the
                                                        alley. They're setting up electrodes, I can tell by the smell of
                                                        ozone.
                                                        <p>
                                                          I bolt back through my back gate, slide through the side gate,
                                                          and am sprinting down the sidewalk. Other dads walking to the
                                                          transit station glance and glare. One of them is flattened by
                                                          a hulk, exposing skull and white femur. I try not to think, I
                                                          let the emotion take over...and I'm sprinting now.
                                                          <p>
                                                            I feel like I'm out of scanning range and I dive into an
                                                            unknown church. I've got half my body under the pew, the
                                                            rest won't fit. My chest is heaving, I'm trying to be quiet.
                                                            I see red lights blinking through the stained glass, and I
                                                            can hear the high pitched whine of dozens of enforcers.
                                                            They're tearing the block apart.
                                                            <p>
